  "<p>Costa of <span style='background-color:#a3b18a;color:white'>Chateau Farms</span> owns 80 acres of land and said he’s allocated one day for each 20 acres of Fresno Irrigation District water. “The rest of the water we need, we draw from the aquifer,” he said.</p>" +

  "<p>“The drought, insect spray, growth spray, and other issues have made agriculture too expensive to continue,” he said.</p>";

  "<p>All around the Fresno, small farm owners are facing similar difficulites as the result of increasing droughts.";

  let divChapter9 =
  "<p>Fresno has often been ranked highest for its production value despite some key factors indicating otherwise. For instance, in the last two decades, rainfall levels— a key factor for irrigation— has been dropping constantly. </p>" +
  "<p><img src='images/rainfall.svg'></p>" +
  "<p>California has also dealt with raging wildfires and heatwaves. How then are farmers sustaining the business and what is the future of farming in Fresno?</p>" +
  "<p>Even with warmer and drier summers, data shows the level of irrigation has gone down in the county.</p>" +
  "<p><img src='images/irrigation.svg'></p>" +
  "<p>To cope with the lack of rainfall, many farmers in Fresno adopt drip irrigation systems, according to Costa. </p>" +
  "<p>“For months we don’t use irrigation water and depend on the aquifer to draw water,” he said. “That requires using pumps which consume a lot of electricity. It is quite expensive for us.”</p>" +
  "<p>Another solution is to fallow land, according to Jeanine Jones, interstate resources manager for the California Department of Water Resources. </p>" +
  "<p>Fallowing means to let plowed land be left unsown for some time to allow it to regain its fertility. </p>" +
  "<p>“At a very ballpark statewide scale, in the last two droughts, about 500,000 acres of agricultural land have been fallowed due to drought, and that's out of a little under nine million irrigated acres,” Jones said.</p>" +
  "<p>In response to less surface water being available in the form of rainfall, farmers have depended more on extracting groundwater, according to Robert Hutmacher, a plant science professor at University of California, Davis.</p>" +
  "<p>Lowered rainfall, combined with heatwaves are obvious indicators of an ongoing climate crisis. Despite this, the California State Board of Food and Agriculture heard a cautiously optimistic appraisal of agriculture’s future through 2050 from economist Dr. Daniel Sumner, director of the Agricultural Issues Center at UC Davis. </p>" +
  "<p>Thomas Tomich, a sustainability, science policy professor at University of California is optimistic the industry will do “just fine.”</p>" +
  "<p>“Our drought records go back hundreds of years and we’re in the biggest drought this place has ever seen,” Tomich said, adding that the county’s farmers depend mostly on groundwater for irrigation. </p>" +
  "<p>Without being able to recharge groundwater, Tomich said he expects a lot of irrigated land in the county to go out of production. That said, farmers are quickly adapting— by changing their crops to less water intensive ones.</p>" +
  "<p>Jones said switching crops is a trend that’s already happened.</p>" +
  "<p>“Because you know, farmers basically follow the markets,” he said. “At the San Joaquin Valley in 1980, or 1990, there were a lot of annual crops such as cotton because the market for cotton was good and they had ample water supplies for it. But as water supplies were reduced and water became more expensive, it was no longer profitable for growers to produce cotton.” </p>" +
  "<p>A majority of farmers subsequently switched to farming almonds, he added.</p>" +
  "<p><img src='images/crop-type.svg'></p>" +
  "<p>“For some commodities, California produces virtually all of U.S.’ production,” Tomich said. “For general categories, fruits and vegetables California produces half of what the US eats.” </p>" +
  "<p>That said, California’s agriculture being hit won’t necessarily impact food security in the country, Tomich is confident.</p>" +
  "<p>“If Americans started eating the diet that’s recommended by the U.S. goverment, we’d need 5 Californias. But, that’s not the case,” he said. “Nobody will starve because they couldn’t get a tomato or peach.”</p>" +
  "<p><<img src='images/agric_states.png'></p>" +
  "<p>Climate change aside, farmers also face other challenges.</p>" +
  "<p>“We are probably the only industry and producers that cannot set their own price,” Costa said. “We don’t get to set the prices we sell for. So we are unable to recoup as much of our expenses as we would.”</p>" +
  "<p>He added that even as food prices seem to have gone up, a bigger share of the increase is going to middlemen, instead of farmers.</p>" +
  "<p>“Almonds used to be $4 a pound. Now farmers get only $1 a pound,” he said.</p>" +
  "<p>What then is the solution?</p>" +
  "<p>“I do not think we’re doomed,” Tomich said. “But we do need to be climate-smart. I don’t think any agriculture on the planet is sustainable right now.”</p>" +
  "<p>His recommendation would be to intervene in the industry through the energy sector. </p>" +
  "<p>“We need to move away from fossil fuels. Agriculture isn’t an easy fix, but not impossible,” he said. “California’s agriculture is very good at reinventing itself.”</p>"

  "<p style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>After a few weeks of the declaration of state of emergency, subway usage in the city reached its lowest point, almost 90% less than the same time period the year before.

  "<p style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>This difference, however, varies across the city, with some parts of it seeing a much steeper decline and others witnessing a stronger recovery.

For example, after a similar decline right after the state of emergency was declared, Citibike has seen its number of users reach and even surpass 2019 levels.

Similarly to Jackson Heights in Queens, the areas subway stations have seen a smaller decrease in use than the rest of the city.
